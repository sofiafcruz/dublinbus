This folder is used for testing purposes

We will dedicate a python file for each section we wish to test.

It follows the following tutorial series:

The folder should be called "tests", but I got some weird icon on the folder so instead used a different folder name

The video also says to delete the tests.py file already included (but I won't for the time being...)

TO RUN TESTS: run the command: 'python3 manage.py test bus_app'

N.B. - WON'T be testing Leap Card, as requires leap card credentials...
